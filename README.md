# Climatework

This board is an attempt to connect talented people with organizations that increase energy efficiency, decrease CO2 emissions, and conserve our natural resources.

## How to add an open position

1. Add the organization name, the job listing url, position and the location to [posts.rss](posts.rss) in a pull request. Don't know how? Ask me fore help!

```xml
<item>
  <title>Upstream Tech</title>
  <link>https://upstream.tech/about</link>
  <description>Machine Learning Engineer, Remote</description>
</li>
```

To support a growing community of technologists and scientists in conservation and energy, you're encouraged to link to this page from a career page or job board. Understanding that it's nontrivial to change a company website, it's not required.
